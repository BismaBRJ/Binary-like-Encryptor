- (+) Added status bar
  - (#) Errors show up here

- (;) Fixed 0.1.0#3-07/10/2015

#0.1.1 (05/10/2015)
- (*) GUI now suits the operating system it is ran on

#0.1.0 (04/10/2015)
- (+) Added simple GUI
  - (#) [OS X] Menu is automatically set up by OS X. The application will have its own menu starting from 0.2.0
  - (!) (0.1.0#2-07/10/2015) Application properties are blank
- (+) Added encryption and decryption functionality
  - (#) Handles invalid encryptions by emptying the output
  - (!) (0.1.0#1-07/10/2015) Upon decrypting: spaces, backspaces, tabs, and newlines are considered part of the encryption and therefore makes empty output
  - (!) (0.1.0#3-07/10/2015) Upon decrypting, the last character outputted may not be correct
  - (!) (0.1.0#4-08/10/2015) Upon decrypting, sometimes the application may not be able to handle invalid encryptions and therefore doesnâ€™t change the output
